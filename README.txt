# Artery

Artery enables V2X simulations based on ETSI ITS-G5 protocols like GeoNetworking and BTP. Single vehicles can be equipped with multiple ITS-G5 services through Artery's middleware, which also provides common Facility objects to these services.

Artery is an extension to the Veins framework. Veins itself is documented at http://veins.car2x.org/
